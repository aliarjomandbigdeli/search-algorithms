# search-algorithms
To use these search algorithms for solving your problem, you should define your problem and it's state classes that extends from Problem and State class.

Use `MyProblem extends Problem` and `MyProblemState extends State` to achieve that.

For example, I model a navigation problem in Romania by defining NavigationProblem and NavState classes. You can see the map of the cities below:
